# Go_Project
A little project to demonstrate my ability to write GoLang
Reads a coded input file and print out text to a terminal

## Steps to use:
1. On the main branch, select `code` -> `Download zip` and unzip the folder
2. Open a terminal of your choice
3. Expand the terminal to fill as much of the screen as possible
4. In the terminal, navigate into the unzipped `Go_Project-main` folder
5. Type the command `go run main.go` and hit enter
