# Go_Project
A little project to demonstrate my ability to write GoLang

## Steps to use:
1. Add this repository to your IDE of choice
2. Navigage to a directory containing the `main.go` and three `.txt` files
3. Expand the terminal to fill as much of the screen as possible
4. Run **"go run main.go"**
