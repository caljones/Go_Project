Hello Jacob!@
This is a small program I made to show off what I've learned about GoLang so far.@
I'm stubborn about learning a new language and so I used no AI to make it.@

I learned how to panic!@@
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH@@

I learned all the nitty...@

while ()@^^^^^^^^@for c := range slice@@

syntax...@@

if( err ==@^^^^^^^^@ err == null {@@^^^^^^@nil {@@

I know how to parse JSON using Go, and make http requests!@
If I wanted to get an absurdly long list of nature tours available in California,@
I can make an API call!@@

I've come to really like Go!@
The simplicity of loops, conditional logic, errors, and variables
makes writing code so much faster.

If you care to take a peak at main.go and input.txt, this program just runs a few
functions I wrote to print out text as if I were typing it, run that animation, and 
read from files.@@

It was fun to make, and in the process, I got a certification in Go!
